	/* What is abstraction:
	 * Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing
	 * the functionality. Its the 3rd pilar of 00ps
	 * Why we should use abstraction:
	 * 1. It reduces the complexity by separating the ideas from
	 * implementations.
	 * 2.We can also enforce rules on other classes.
	 * How can we use the abstraction:
	 * We can use abstraction in our code with the help of abstract 
	 * classes and interfaces
	 * We create abstract methods with only the header and mark the class
	 * as abstract now every class that will be inheriting from this
	 * class will either implement those methods or mark the child class abstract
	 * as well.
	 * Rules:
	 * 1. Abstract methods can't have a body.
	 * 2.As soon as we have one abstract method in a class that class 
	 * must be declared as abstract.
	 * 3.Once a class inherit from an abstract class that class must
	 * implement the abstract methods or it should be marked as
	 * abstract.
	 * 4.We can have normal methods with body and abstract methods
	 * inside a class.
	 * 5. We can't create the object of abstract classes
	 * 6.Abstract classes can't be declared final classes
	 * 7. We can have everything inside an abstract class that we
	 * have in normal class only thing that different is we can't
	 * create the object of that class.
